    <p> This website was created by Chris Yang and Justin Wang. Our topic was Dark Souls because we both love to play games and enjoy the different aspects of the game. A challenge that was presented was finding certain elements that match the way we the website to look like. Most of the coding was done by Chris while the information and image gathering was done by Justin. The project was very fun to do because we always wanted to build a website and make it look very official. All in all there weere some challenges and fun times.</p>
