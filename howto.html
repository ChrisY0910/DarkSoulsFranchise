      <h2> Bosses </h2>
      <br>
      <h3>One off the things that made Dark Souls so popular was the bosses. Many of the bosses were difficult and made players want to quit the game. There are many bosses in the game, some are just bosses the player has to get passed to continue the storyline. For example, asylum demon, Taurus demon, Capra demon, gaping dragon, the last giant, the pursuer, the ancient sentinels, champion gundyr, and more.
Some are bosses the player has to beat in the main game like lord gwyn, bed of chaos, old iron king, Neto, and more. Others are just optional bosses the player can fight to challenge their skills like the king’s pets, blue smelter demon, and more.</h3>
